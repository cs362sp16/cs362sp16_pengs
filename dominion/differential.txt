I have test 8 different dominion implementation with several seed, I didn¡¯t found any fault in diff tools. Because all of them is same, I don¡¯t know who is correct or not. I think that his is not an ideal case for differential test, because all of dominion implementation is almost same

My random dominion tester run over 20 times, and obtain over 60% coverage of dominion.c
