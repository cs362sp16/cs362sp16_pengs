bug fixed file is dominion_bugfixed_version. Not the normal dominion.c

I decide to take GUI debugger for debug, so I put my file in xCode, and take bug from my previous unittest bug report.

I will test scoreFor function.

First, I set break point in my unittest1.c in line 17. It¨s after initializeGame. I check the memory, so I can see all information after initializeGame.

！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
Here is logs:

after initializeGame For player1:
hand: 1 estate, 4 copper.
handCount: 5
deck: 3 estate, 7 copper. ( It¨s like deck card is not disappear after it from deck to hand)
deckCount: 5
discard: null
discardCount: 0
playedCard: 0
score: 0

after first loop in scorefFor function:
score become 1, because it¨s search for estate.
work is correct

the second loops, discardCount is 0, so not running.

However the third loops, author said that it¨s search for deck, but loops var is discardCount in line 444. Bug is here. If it¨s i< discardCount, scoreFor function will never search deck score in first round, because discardCount is 0 in first round.

So I decide to change this var to deckCount.

change line 444
for (i = 0; i < state->discardCount[player]; i++)
to 
for (i = 0; i < state->deckCount[player]; i++)

And then I run the test again. scoreFor return correct score.

Although deck card is not disappear after it¨s from deck to hand, deck count is 5 after initializeGame, and author take card from Array 5 to 9 to hand, So he avoid this bugs here. I think that it¨s acceptable, because we don¨t want deck card is gone.

Debug work is done. Fixed this bug.

Baron is bug, from my classmate report, so I am debug this things

Here is logs:


after initializeGame and set up hand card :
hand: 2 estate, 2 baron, 1 copper
handCount: 5
numBuys: 1
coins: 3
numAction: 2


after jump into baron cardEffect part :
I found bugs in line 796:
gainCard(estate, state, 0, currentPlayer);//Gain an estate

jump into gainCard function, it should get estate card in hand, but he add it to discard function. because to flag is 0, but it should be 2

I fix this bug by change parameter in this gainCard function
change to gainCard(estate, state, 2, currentPlayer);//Gain an estate

back to baron cardEffect, line 769, author repeat decrease supplyCount, gainCard function have decreased supplyCount already, so I will delete this line for avoid repeat decrease supplyCount.

after first playCard:
hand: 2 baron, 3 estate, 1 copper
handCount: 6
coins: 3

And author still not delete baron from hands, that¨s problem. Fix bug by add delete hand card in baron cardEffect part.
Add line 757: discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

And coin part, because author have update coin in playHand function, it always reset coin by searing copper, sliver, gold. It overwrite what the cardEffect, so I delete that line(line 267) in playHand function for avoid coin part bugs.


Debug work is done. Fixed this bug.

Agans¨ principles:

Rule #1 ＾understand the system￣
   I read the dominon.h file first for understand this dominion system.
   Read the notes in code, to know what each function do.
   Go to dominion strategy website, understand what rule of test card.
   So this what the base of the test.
Rule #2 ＾Make if Fail￣
   I write unitTest to make it fail.
   This is the first step to do test. ;)
Rule #5 ＾Change One Thing at a Time￣
   I found problem is here, so I only change one var. This make sure that no       other problem is combine with this problem.
